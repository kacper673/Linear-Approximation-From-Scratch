# Linear Approximation & Interpolation in C++ with SFML

This project implements **linear regression (approximation)** and **piecewise linear interpolation** of 2D data points in C++.  
It provides a simple **SFML-based visualization**, allowing the user to input or generate points, and then see the resulting line of best fit or interpolation directly on screen.

## Features

- Input data points manually or generate random ones.
- **Linear approximation** using least squares method.
- **Uncertainty estimation** of regression coefficient.
- **Piecewise linear interpolation** connecting all data points in order.
- Real-time visualization in a 2D coordinate system using **SFML**..
- Option to display:
  - Only points,
  - Points with linear approximation,
  - Points with interpolation,
  - Points with both.
